<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This was a senior design project created in Fall 2020 for iOS and Android with React-Native on the frontend and node.js on the backend. The app is simple; it is essentially AirBnb for parking instead of lodging. Hosts can list a number of spots on their property for a certain price, and users can search for spots in a specified range from their current location. The host and renter can then negotiate a length of stay for access to their parking spot.
